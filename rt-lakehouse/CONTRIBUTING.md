# Load tests
locust --host=http://localhost:8000 -u 10 -r 2 -t 60s
```

### Test Coverage
We aim for 80%+ test coverage. All new features should include:
- Unit tests for core logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical workflows

## 📋 Development Standards

### Code Quality
- **Python**: Follow PEP 8, use type hints, docstrings for public functions
- **JavaScript/React**: ESLint configuration, meaningful component names
- **SQL**: Consistent formatting, clear table/column names
- **Docker**: Multi-stage builds, minimal image sizes, security scanning

### Commit Messages
